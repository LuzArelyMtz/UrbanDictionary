    <string name="tvDefinition">One of the smartest medical dramas to ever have aired, House, M.D. features the maverick, anti-social doctor Gregory House (Hugh Laurie) who specializes in infectious diseases and does whatever it takes to solve the puzzling cases that come his way.   A show that should rob this year\'s Emmys if not for its sheer quality then for Laurie\'s brilliant acting.</string>
